# 🎯 Quiz App (Logic-Driven, Vanilla JavaScript)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **logic-driven quiz application** built using **vanilla JavaScript**, with a strong focus on **core programming concepts** rather than UI-heavy design.  
The application demonstrates clean separation between **quiz logic (engine)** and **presentation (UI)**.

The interface is **inspired by the Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC) quiz format**, emphasizing clarity, focus, and timed decision-making.

## ✨ Key Highlights
- 🧠 Logic-first quiz engine design
- 🎲 Randomized question order
- ⏱️ Configurable per-question timer
- 🗂️ Question categories (Java, OOP, Collections, etc.)
- 📊 Detailed performance report after quiz completion
- 🎮 KBC-inspired visual layout for an engaging quiz experience
- 🤖 AI-assisted development for design refinement, debugging, and code structuring

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – structure
- **CSS3** – styling and layout
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – core logic and state management

No frameworks or external libraries were used.

---

## 🧩 Application Design Philosophy
The quiz was designed as a **reusable engine**, independent of the UI layer.  
All core logic—such as scoring, timing, randomization, and reporting—resides in a dedicated quiz engine module.

This approach ensures:
- Better maintainability
- Easy future enhancements
- Clear demonstration of core programming skills

---

## ⏱️ Timer & Question Handling
- Each question has a **configurable time limit**
- Questions are **auto-evaluated** if time runs out
- The current question set is intentionally small to highlight **engine design**, not data volume

The quiz engine supports **any number of questions** without requiring code changes.

---

## 📊 Detailed Report
At the end of the quiz, users receive:
- Correct vs selected answers
- Time taken per question
- Category-wise performance summary
- Final score overview

This adds transparency and mirrors real-world assessment systems.

---

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development
AI tools were used responsibly during development to:
- Refine application structure
- Improve logic clarity
- Validate edge cases
- Enhance UI alignment with quiz-style systems

All implementation decisions and integrations were **manually reviewed and adapted**.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Larger question banks via external JSON
- Difficulty levels
- Persistent score tracking
- Accessibility improvements
